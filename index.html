	<h3> Our stop-motion animation,<i> Plastic Wave</i>, is meant to help viewers visualize and understand the effects of water pollution on the environment and its organisms. Water pollution, of any form, negatively affects the wildlife and health of the ocean. It can never be reversed, but with the awareness and action of the people, it can be forestalled.</h3> 

	<h2><br><strong>⸻ The Timeline ⸻</strong>
		<h3>Day 1</h3>
		     <h5> Initially, the animation was meant to depict a piranha tank that slowly got littered over time. Eventually, once the pirnahas were swimming in their and other filth, a hand would reach in to clean the tank. The piranhas would be wary at first, but accept the work of the hand. After all of the litter was cleaned out of the tank, the piranhas would offer their treasure to the hand, and the story would come to a close. </h5>
