		<h4 style="margin-left:40px" class="h2"><i> - Annie Leonard</i></h4>
	<h3 class="h2"> Our stop-motion animation,<i> Plastic Wave</i>, is meant to help viewers visualize and understand the effects of water pollution on the environment and its organisms. Water pollution, of any form, negatively affects 
	     the wildlife and health of the ocean. It can never be reversed, but with the awareness and action of the people, it can be forestalled.</h3> 

	<h1 class=h1""><strong>⸻ The Purpose ⸻</strong></h1>
		<p>Plastic pollution is one of the world's gravest problems. Supported by corporate power abuse and the individuals’ negligence on the severity of the issue, plastics' presence in our oceans continues to grow despite the multitude 
		   of benevolent campaigns and fundraisers created to combat this issue. <br>
		   To show and educate others on some of the issues that contribute to more plastic in our oceans, I created an interactive loopy model (format provided by Nicky Case). </p>

	<h1 class="h1"><strong>⸻ The Timeline ⸻</strong></h1>
		<h2 class="h2">Day 1: First Drafts</h2>
		     <p>The first day of our animation process has begun. First, we created the initial drafts and storyboards of our separate animation ideas. My idea was originally meant to depict a piranha tank that slowly got littered over 
			     time and eventually, a hand would reach in to clean the tank. I wanted to show some distrust and wariness between the hand and piranhas, so I was thinking of having the piranhas bite the hand (this idea was scrapped 
			     because we didn’t feel the scene would properly convey the point). After all of the litter was cleaned out of the tank, the piranhas would offer their treasure to the hand, and the story would close.</p>
			
			<h3 class="h2">Initial Storyboard</h3>
		<img src="20230117095820.jpg" alt="Animation Storyboard height="600" width="400">
		      <p>The storyboard I drew had little notes on what would occur during each scene and the mood that accompanied it.</p>

			<h3 class="h2"> First Draft of Characters and Conflicts </h3>
				<table border="2">
				  <tr><h3 class="p"><strong>
				     <th></th>
				     <th>PROTAGONIST</th>
				     <th>ANTAGONIST</th>
				     <th>SUPPORTING CHARACTER(S)</th>
				  </strong></tr></h3>
				  <tr>
				     <td><i>Description</i><br>
				     <td>The Piranhas
				     <td>The Pollutants
				     <td>The Hand
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				     <td><i>Strength(s), Weakness(es), and/or Vulnerability(ies)</i>
				     <td><strong>Strength(s):</strong><br>Scary(?)<br><strong>Weakness(es):</strong><br>Can't remove the plastic themselves<br><strong>Vulnerability(ies):</strong><br>The plastic
				     <td><strong>Strength(s):</strong><br>Upsets the piranhas'<br><strong>Weakness(es):</strong><br>Can be taken out of the tank; is an inanimate object<br><strong>Vulnerability(ies):</strong><br>N/A
				     <td><strong>Strength(s):</strong><br>Not afraid of the piranhas'<br><strong>Weakness(es):</strong><br>N/A<br><strong>Vulnerability(ies):</strong><br>A little wary of the piranhas'
				 </tr>
				 <tr>
				     <td><i>Other details, information, etc.</i>
				     <td>Diligent, but can’t attack the threats; “all bark, no bite.”
				     <td>Builds up in the tank until the piranhas give up
				     <td>Finally steps in to save the piranhas
				</table>
	
			<p>In addition to creating our storyboard, we each created a table to understand the purpose and depth of our characters. As previously stated, I was contemplating having the piranhas bite the hand; I was also pondering 
			 the idea of having the hand be wary of the piranhas to show that even though it may be scary to help others, it is the right thing to do (this idea got scrapped for the same reasons). </p>
						    
		<h2 class="h2">Day 2: Coding</h2>
			<p>On The second day, we worked on programming our lighting. My group had already decided we would be going with my idea, so we needed to program something that would toggle between light, giving the illusion 
			      of waves and getting brighter systematically. So, with the help MakeCode, we created two types of code:</p>
 </p>
			
<h5 class="bluetext"> forever(function () { <br>
   light.showRing( <br>
   `blue blue blue white white white white blue blue blue`<br>
   )<br>
   light.setBrightness(40)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `blue blue white white white white white white blue blue`<br>
   )<br>
   light.setBrightness(50)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `blue white white white blue blue white white white blue`<br>
   )<br>
   light.setBrightness(60)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `white white white blue blue blue blue white white white`<br>
   )<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.setBrightness(60)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `blue blue blue white white white white blue blue blue`<br>
   )<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.setBrightness(50)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
})<br></h5>

		<p>one mimicked the sun in clear water...</p>

<h5 class="greentext">forever(function () {<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `blue blue blue green green green green blue blue blue`<br>
   )<br>
   light.setBrightness(40)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `blue blue green green green green green green blue blue`<br>
   )<br>
   light.setBrightness(50)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `blue green green green blue blue green green green blue`<br>
   )<br>
   light.setBrightness(60)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `green green green blue blue blue blue green green green`<br>
   )<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.setBrightness(60)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `blue blue blue green green green green blue blue blue`<br>
   )<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.setBrightness(50)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
})<br></h5>
						 
		<p>and the other mimicked it in polluted waters.</p>
						 
		<h2 class="h2">Day 3: Cutting... All... Day</h2>
			<p>The third day, we started testing how our animation was going to run. The only problem was we had nothing to film with. So, we started cutting...</p>
		     Le Image
		     	<p>...and cutting</p>
		     Le Image
		        <p>...and cutting</p>
		     Le Image
		        <p>...and cutting.</p>
		     <p> Thankfully, we were able to finsish cutting out our elements out before the end of class and film the beginning of the animation; although, this test run wouldn't be used in the final animation.</p>
		
		<h2 class="h2">Day 4: Filming!</h2>
		     <p> On the fourth day, we finished more than half of our animation. With the beginning and flashback scenes done, we all were confident we would be able to finish the animation on the fifth day.</p>
		
		<h2 class="h2">Day 5: Done, and Shipped</h2>
		     <p> On the fifth day, we finished filming our animation! There was a little disagreement on how the video would end and we ended up deviating from the original storyboard, but we were able to find a way 
			      to tie the animation together. In addition, everything on DragonFrame was ready to be edited by Thomas, so the class ended perfectly on schedule with the deadline of the assignment.</p>
</p>
		
		<h2 class="h2">Day 6: Final Touches</h2>
		     <p> The sixth day was the deadline for the assignment, so there was a hectic atmosphere in class. Thomas was able to edit and add music to the video over the weekend, so feedback was the only thing we were focused 
			      on during that class period. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to get a peer review from another group that also was doing stop-motion animation, but that wasn't of importance to us. With the edited 
			      video done and no more feedback to give, I was able to turn in my assignment on January 15, 2023. </p>
