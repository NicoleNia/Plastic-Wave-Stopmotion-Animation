	<h3> Our stop-motion animation,<i> Plastic Wave</i>, is meant to help viewers visualize and understand the effects of water pollution on the environment and its organisms. Water pollution, of any form, negatively affects 
	     the wildlife and health of the ocean. It can never be reversed, but with the awareness and action of the people, it can be forestalled.</h3> 

	<h2 class="h1"><br><strong>⸻ The Timeline ⸻</strong>
		<h2 class="h2">Day 1: First Drafts</h2>
		     <p> The first day, we created the intial drafts and storyboard of our animation. Orignally, the animation was meant to depict a piranha tank that slowly got littered over time. 
			  Eventually, once the pirnahas were swimming in their and other filth, a hand would reach in to clean the tank. The piranhas would be wary at first, but accept the work of the hand. After all of the 
			     litter was cleaned out of the tank, the piranhas would offer their treasure to the hand, and the story would come to a close. </p>

		<h2>Day 2: Coding</h2>
			<p>The second day, we worked on progamming our lighting. In my groups case, we had already decided we would be going with my idea, plastic pollution, so we needed to program 
			something that would toggle between light, giving the illusion of waves and getting brighter systematically. So, with the help MakeCode, we created two types of code: </p>
			
<h5 class="bluetext"> forever(function () { <br>
   light.showRing( <br>
   `blue blue blue white white white white blue blue blue`<br>
   )<br>
   light.setBrightness(40)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `blue blue white white white white white white blue blue`<br>
   )<br>
   light.setBrightness(50)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `blue white white white blue blue white white white blue`<br>
   )<br>
   light.setBrightness(60)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `white white white blue blue blue blue white white white`<br>
   )<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.setBrightness(60)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `blue blue blue white white white white blue blue blue`<br>
   )<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.setBrightness(50)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
})<br></h5>

		<p>one mimicked the sun in clear water...</p>

<h5 class="greentext">forever(function () {<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `blue blue blue green green green green blue blue blue`<br>
   )<br>
   light.setBrightness(40)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `blue blue green green green green green green blue blue`<br>
   )<br>
   light.setBrightness(50)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `blue green green green blue blue green green green blue`<br>
   )<br>
   light.setBrightness(60)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `green green green blue blue blue blue green green green`<br>
   )<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.setBrightness(60)<br>
   light.showRing(<br>
   `blue blue blue green green green green blue blue blue`<br>
   )<br>
   pause(500)<br>
   light.setBrightness(50)<br>
   pause(500)<br>
})<br></h5>
						 
		<p>and the other mimicked it in polluted waters.</p>
						 
		<h2>Day 3: Cutting... All... Day</h2>
			<p>The third day, we started testing how our animation was going to run. The only problem, we had nothing to film with. So, we started cutting...</p>
		     Le Image
		     	<p>...and cutting</p>
		     Le Image
		        <p>...and cutting</p>
		     Le Image
		        <p>...and cutting.</p>
		     <p> Thankfully, we were able to finsish cutting out the elements out before the end of class and film the beginning of the animation; although, this test run wouldn't be used in the final animation.</p>
		
		<h2>Day 4: Filming!</h2>
		     <p> On the fourth day, we finished more than half of our animation. With the beginning and flashback scene done, we all were confident we would be able to finish the animation on the fifth day.</p>
		
		<h2>Day 5: Done, and Shipped
		     <p> On the fifth day, we finished filming our animation! There was a little dissagreement on how the video would end and we ended up deviating from the original storyboard, but we were able to find a way to tie 
		     the animation together. In addition, everyhing on DragonFrame was ready to be edited by Thomas, so class ended perfectly on schedule with the deadline of the assignment.</p>
		
		<h2>Day 6: Final Touches
		     <p> The sixth day was the deadline of the assignment, so there was a rushed atmosphere is class. Thomas was able to edit and add music to the video, so feedback was the only thing we were focused on that class period. 
		     Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to get peer review from another group who also was doing stopmotion animation, but it wasn't of importance to us. With the edited video done and no more feedback to give, I 
		     turned in my assignment on January 15, 2023. </p>
