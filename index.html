	<h3> Our stop-motion animation,<i> Plastic Wave</i>, is meant to help viewers visualize and understand the effects of water pollution on the environment and its organisms. Water pollution, of any form, negatively affects the wildlife and health of the ocean. It can never be reversed, but with the awareness and action of the people, it can be forestalled.</h3>
